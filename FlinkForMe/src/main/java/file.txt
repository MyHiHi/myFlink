Recent development in Submodule topologies and applications of MMC
  Modular Multilevel Converter is a remarkable topology for medium and high power conversion systems. In recent years, it has been prominent over other power converters because of its exceptional features including modularity and flexibility to apt any voltage level, remarkable harmonic performance, no dc-link capacitors, transformerless operation,absence of ac side filters, and capacitive nature of phase legs.However, there are some challenges for instance submodule capacitor voltage balancing, output current control, circulating current control, minimization of submodule capacitor voltage ripple, dc side faults, and efficient submodule topologies which have been addressed by the research studies over time. 
The most important constituent of MMC structure is an SM which is responsible for power conversion. Usually, they are connected in series connections but in some hybrid MMC topologies, they operate with parallel connections. There are different schemes of SMs and the most common are half bridge and full-bridge SMs. Due to recent advancements, now there are around 36 different SM structures to date and still increasing to enhance the performance of MMC. We have classified them according to their output voltage levels and voltages generated in normal operating conditions are considered as voltage levels.
MMC offers several advantages over other VSCs like; high voltage handling capability, lower switching losses, simple structure, modularity, and scalability. It raises the interest of many researchers for its industrial applications. 
The most modern application of MMC is a battery energy storage system (BESS) and it has gathered a lot of attention by researchers in recent years.
The HVDC power transmission systems are more efficient, economical, and practicable than HVAC transmission systems for long-distance power transmission. It is due to the reason that HVDC systems have many advantages like; high controllability, bus-bar structure is not very expensive as it is in HVAC, minimal electromagnetic interference, low losses (only active power flow), capability for the interconnection of asynchronous systems, and it increases power quality [112].However, the cost of conversion structures is high because of high number of semiconducting devices which makes the distance limitations for its feasible implementation.
MMC is considered as a reliable topology for medium voltage (high power) drive (MDV) applications because of its scalability, modularity, redundancy at low expense, operation without ac side filters with line motors, increase in dynamic characteristics with high switching frequency, and unique dc link.
Development Prospect of MMC include Design and implementation of new SM structures  which have characteristics like; dc fault handling capability, low switching losses, low switch count, smaller SM capacitance, small footprint, cost effective, and high-performance.

In the last decade, researchers have achieved extensive developments in the control, SM topologies, modulation schemes, and applications of MMC. It gathered the attention of several industrial applications in recent years and became a constituent part of new HVDC systems, medium voltage drives, and flexible ac transmission systems. Yet, there are several issues which are necessary to be addressed to broaden its area of possible applications. Among them, the most critical issue is the SM capacitor voltage ripple in medium voltage drives. It increases the cost and footprint of the overall system because the high capacitance value capacitors are
required to mitigate the capacitor voltage ripple during low/zero frequency operation.
